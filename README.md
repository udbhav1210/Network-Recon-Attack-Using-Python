This project pertains to the development of a script/tool using Python that allows a user to carry out active and passive reconnaissance on their network. In active mode, the script will send out ARP requests to all the hosts within the user’s network and then listen for ARP responses. It will then display the MAC address and IP address of the hosts from which the ARP response was received. In passive mode, the script will act like a listener for ARP responses from all the hosts on the user’s network and display their MAC and IP addresses.
The user can also track and sort the activity of all the hosts on their network which can help them determine which of the hosts are the most active and which ones are the least active. Hosts with high activity are usually critical devices that handle network operations. Whereas, hosts with little to no activity are probably in neglected domains with weak security. Such hosts can be used for monitoring and persistence purposes.
The output of the script updates dynamically based on the user’s input. It also displays the total count of hosts discovered on the user’s network. The python script in this project has been written as per university guidelines and is intended solely for educational purpose. It must only be used in controlled environments such as a lab. Any malicious use of the script is discouraged and condoned.
